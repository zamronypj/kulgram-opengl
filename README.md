#Kulgram OpenGL

This repository is intended as supplemental material for Basic of 3D Programming with OpenGL and Pascal online lecture in Pascal ID programming group

It contains some sample demos how to use OpenGL with Pascal programming language. It is developed with Lazarus IDE. OpenGL calls are abstracted in
a thin layer of software interface hopefully with intention that it can be extended to include Direct3D implementation also.
